Todo:
	- Move difference algorithm to API manager
		- should work as currently works, but consolidates code to a better place
	- Implement HTTP/2 for all endpoints
	- Implement SSE for API endpoint
	- Update UI to deal with SEE datagrams instead of API responses
	- *All in session* average kills per game, highest kills, wins, highest damage, games played
	- styles for match history
		- make styles settings somehow so I don't save only mine to git
