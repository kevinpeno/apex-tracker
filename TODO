  ✔ move the timeout from client to server
  ☐ *All in session* avg kill/game, highest kills, wins, highest dmg, # played
  ☐ Some kinda hot/not hot meter based on averages of gameplay over time
  ☐ Implement HTTP/2 for server
  ☐ Implement SSE for API endpoint
  ☐ Update UI to use SSE responses
  ☐ make styles settings somehow so I don't save only mine to git
